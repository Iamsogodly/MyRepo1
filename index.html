          church was opened in 1965. A fire broke out in 1966, and the church was fixed
          and reopened in 1967. Then, in 1971, the pastor died of heart disease and a New
          pastor was appointed. The church has been renovated twice- once in 1978 and the 
          second, in 2000. In 2004, the pastor was replaced again. Today, the church is
          in full service, but the church will be renovated in November, 2024. The pastor
          will change once again in 2027-2028 time period.

        <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The food options and responsibilities
        to consider, canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have  ever been in the 
        past. Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients 
        help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who 
        accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps
        track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements that they may have. Ordering online
        by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making
        it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key. This
        online ordering will be available soon.

        <h4>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h4>

          The reasons for an IOAMS (Implemented Online Attendance Management System) are:
          1. ACCURACY
          Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices, 
          Automated Attendance Management Systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable
          and costly errors with manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate
          performance and payroll data. 
          2. ECONOMICS
          Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by
          putting an end to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness, time abuse
          and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by the Axsium Group found that large 
          organisations save up to ₹150,000 per employeee after implementing automated attendance management
          systems.
          3. PRODUCTIVITY 
          Productivity/Efficiency monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time-consuming, 
          laborious and expensive affair. It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards, create 
          schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up precious
          administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of 
          employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and 
          effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources that lead to 
          increased productivity and improves profits. IOAMS also can do much more like Visibility, 
          Insights, Hassle-free Workflow Management, Flexibility, Integration, Configuration, Real-Time 
          Tracking, Security and Compliance.
